Her card was declined yesterday evening at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. Can you look into what happened and make sure it works for the trip? She'll be there from Monday and is panicking a bit about having no card access.\n\n2. I need a Q1 2026 spend breakdown for Sophia's card for our internal audit — ideally with merchant-level detail and cost centre codes. Our finance team needs this by end of week if possible.\n\n3. Her current limit is GBP 25,000. Given the APAC roadshow (client dinners, hotels across Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong), would it be possible to review and increase to GBP 35,000?

SINGAPORE DECLINE — RESOLVED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nThe decline at Marina Bay Sands was due to a geographic restriction on Sophia's card — Singapore was not in her approved travel regions list. This has nothing to do with the card being blocked or any security concern; it's a straightforward travel setting.\n\nWe've now activated the following regions for Sophia's card (••••4421):\n\n • Singapore (SGP) — active immediately\n • Japan (JPN) — active immediately\n • Hong Kong (HKG) — active immediately\n\nAll three are live as of today and will auto-revert on 30 March 2026 once the roadshow window closes. Sophia should have no further issues using the card across all three destinations.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n2. Q1 2026 SPEND REPORT — ATTACHED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nI've attached Sophia's Q1 2026 spend report in Excel format, formatted to Aon's standard template with merchant-level detail and cost centre codes.\n\n Period: 1 January — 31 March 2026\n Transactions: 84\n Total spend: GBP 21,480.60\n Level 3 data: Available on 73% of transactions (line-item detail, GL codes)\n Format: Excel — Aon standard reporting template\n\nPlease let me know if your finance team needs anything adjusted — happy to re-run the query with different filters or date ranges.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n3. LIMIT INCREASE — CONFIRMED\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nSophia's card limit has been temporarily increased from GBP 25,000 to GBP 35,000, effective immediately. This will auto-revert to GBP 25,000 on 30 March 2026, aligned with the end of the APAC roadshow.\n\nRef: LIM-2026-0309-44212\n\nShe should have plenty of headroom for the trip. If the roadshow runs over or the limit needs further review, just drop us a note.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIf there's anything else you need before Sophia heads off, don't hesitate to get in touch.\n\nKind regards,\n\nDavid Mensah\nSenior Card Consultant | HSBC Commercial Cards\nd.mensah@hsbc.com | +44 20 7991 8847\nHSBC Bank plc | 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ"
