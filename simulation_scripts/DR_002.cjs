const EMAIL_STEP1_BODY = `Dear HSBC Commercial Cards Team,

I am writing to formally raise a dispute on behalf of Amara Diallo (Head of IT & Infrastructure, Linklaters LLP), card ending 3874, regarding a duplicate charge from Adobe Systems Europe Ltd.

BACKGROUND

During our monthly programme reconciliation on 14 March 2026, I identified that card ••••3874 has been charged GBP 4,180.00 by Adobe Systems on two occasions within two days:

  - Charge 1: GBP 4,180.00 — 1 March 2026 (transaction settled 2 March)
  - Charge 2: GBP 4,180.00 — 3 March 2026 (transaction settled 4 March)

Both charges are for the annual Creative Cloud for Enterprise licence renewal for Linklaters (85 seats). Only one annual renewal was due and only one invoice was raised (Invoice ADOBE-INV-2026-LNK-00847).

STEPS TAKEN

I contacted Adobe Systems' billing team on 5 March 2026. On 7 March 2026, Adobe confirmed in writing that both charges arose from a batch processing error — the same transaction was submitted twice in Adobe's March billing run. Adobe advised that a refund was being raised internally. As of today, 15 March 2026 — 12 days after the duplicate charge — no credit has appeared on card ••••3874.

I am attaching the following:
  1. Adobe invoice ADOBE-INV-2026-LNK-00847 (single invoice — GBP 4,180.00 — one renewal)
  2. Adobe's written acknowledgement of the duplicate processing error (email dated 7 March 2026)
  3. Card statement excerpt showing both charges

Please advise on the chargeback process and let us know if any further information is needed.

Kind regards,

const EMAIL_STEP7_BODY = `Dear Tom,

Thank you for raising this dispute. I am writing to confirm that we have formally filed a chargeback with Mastercard in respect of the duplicate Adobe Systems charge on Amara Diallo's card (••••3874).

CASE DETAILS

  HSBC Case Reference:       CB-2026-0315-LNK-0082

  Disputed Merchant:         Adobe Systems Europe Ltd

  Mastercard Reason Code:    4834 — Duplicate Processing
  Date Filed:                15 March 2026

The charge of GBP 4,180.00 on 1 March 2026 (the original annual renewal) will remain on the account and is not in dispute.

PROVISIONAL CREDIT

A provisional credit of GBP 4,180.00 has been applied to the Linklaters LLP programme account (LNK-PROG-UK-0019) today, 15 March 2026.

Please note that this credit is conditional pending the outcome of the Mastercard investigation. Given that Adobe Systems has already acknowledged the duplicate processing error in writing, we expect the chargeback to be accepted without challenge. We will confirm this to you as soon as the outcome is received.

NEXT STEPS

Adobe Systems' bank has until 29 April 2026 to respond. We will monitor the case and update you as soon as a decision is received.

You do not need to take any further action at this stage.
